MASSACR
=======
Modeling Altered Seafloor: Simulation and Climatic Response

BACKGROUND
=======
MASSACR improves upon its predecessor, SWAGCUNT, with cleaner output, faster solvers, 
and improved functionality for all of your porous-media-flow-coupled-to-aqueous-
geochemistry needs.

STUFF/THINGS
=======
*.f90 includes the model (massacr.f90) and modules that initialize things, carry global things,
and hold the functions and subroutines that comprise the solvers.

*.py are for visualization and occasionally post-processing using NUMPY and MATPLOTLIB.
